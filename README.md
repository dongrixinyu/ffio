**ffio** is not just another wrapper of the FFmpeg executable.  
It directly integrates the FFmpeg C API, and is mainly designed for streaming 
that specifically deals with raw RGB data.


# Insight

```
[Video]       [FFIO]      [Raw-RGB-Image]    [FFIO]          [Video]
   ◎   ----  (decoding)  ---->   □
                                 ◆
                                 □   ---->  (encoding)  ---->   ◎
```

There are primarily two ways to utilize ffio:
1. **Decoding**: extract images in RGB format from a provided video, either from a local file or a live stream.
2. **Encoding**: encode provided RGB images, write them into a local video file or a live stream. 

Naturally, you can chain two ffio instances together to facilitate video transformation.
However, if you don't have to do some stuff with raw RGB images, simply 
consider using ffmpeg as a more straightforward solution.

Just keep in mind, the main character in **ffio** are `images in raw format`.

# Features
- [x] **Easy to use**: You don't have to tackle the complex video processing problems concerning FFmpeg anymore.
Simply follow the [examples](https://github.com/dongrixinyu/ffio/blob/main/example/encode_frames.py).
- [x] **Stability**: Instead of forking a ffmpeg process and exchanging data via pipes, 
you can now interact directly with ffmpeg's C context.
- [x] **Hardware acceleration support**: Simply turn `hw_enabled` to `True` to enable hardware acceleration when creating ffio.
Nvidia CUDA is currently available.
- [x] **Shared memory support**: Interact with image data across multiple processes using shared memory, 
reducing redundant data copying.(Currently, only passed tests on Linux platforms.)
- [ ] **Send or recv SEI packets**
- [ ] **Handle image with other formats**
- [ ] **Handle non-video data**. Audio, or subtitle.

# Installation

**ffio** depends on `FFmpeg` dynamic linking libraries. So it's necessary to install FFmpeg before ffio.

We provide 3 methods to install ffio.

If you are not familiar with C, and not willing to deal with anything about C:

## 1. pull docker image from docker hub (**recommended**)
```
$ docker pull jionlp/ffio:latest
$ docker run -it jionlp/ffio:latest /bin/bash  # run into the container.
$ (in docker container) python
```

## 2. Quick start
- It takes only three lines of code to run a decoder to extract images from a video.

```python
import ffio
url     = "path_to_file or url_for_live_stream"
decoder = ffio.FFIO(url)
image   = decoder.decode_one_frame()
```

Or, if you wanna build a docker by yourself from a custom GitHub branch.

## 2. build docker image by yourself from GitHub

You can first clone this repo via git, and then build a docker with all libs installed. 
You do not need to configure compilation params anymore.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dongrixinyu/ffio
$ cd ffio
$ docker build -t jionlp/ffio:(your custom version) .
```

If you wanna run ffio in your host OS, rather than a docker container, you can

## 3. Install ffio by yourself

This method is a little bit difficult if you are not familiar with `gcc`, `make`, `cmake` and trivial concerning `ffmpeg` compilation. 
But if you can configure `ffmpeg, python include path, dynamic library path` smoothly, just take a try.

#### Pre-Installation-requirements

- gcc, make, cmake tools etc.
- ffmpeg>=4.2.0 should have been installed correctly.
- Python>=3.8

#### Installation method

- install FFmpeg from source code - [refer to Dockerfile](https://github.com/dongrixinyu/ffio/blob/main/Dockerfile) or documents on other websites.

- install ffio via github + pip
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dongrixinyu/ffio
$ cd ffio
$ ./compiler.sh  # you should configure all kinds of paths according to your OS environment, otherwise you would encounter errors.
$ pip install -e .
```

# Usage

Examples of how to use ffio are given in the hyperlinks:
